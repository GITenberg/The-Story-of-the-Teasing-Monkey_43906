<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time
there was a very mischievous
little monkey,
who lived in a big banyan
tree, and his name
was Jacko.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="283" height="226" alt="fierce lion and lioness" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the jungle
below there lived a huge,
fierce old lion and
lioness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="302" height="388" alt="monkey hanging from tree pulling lions' tails" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Jacko was a very
teasing monkey. He
used to climb down the
long trailing roots of the
banyan tree, and pull the
tails of all the other
creatures, and then
scamper up again, before
they could catch him.</p>

<p>And he was so bold,
he even pulled the tails
of the lion and lioness
one day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>This made them so
angry that&mdash;</p>

<p>They went to a grim
old bear they knew, and
they arranged with him
that he should come with
them to the banyan tree,
when Jacko was away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>So he came, and standing
on the lion's head,
he gnawed the roots
through till they were
so thin they would not
bear a jerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>And next time Jacko
pulled the lion's tail he
gave a great tug&mdash;the
roots broke, and down
fell Jacko, into the huge,
fierce grim old lion's
jaws!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="279" height="178" alt="little monkey under lion's paw with lioness watching" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here, my dear!"
roared the lion.</p>

<p>The lioness came and
looked at Jacko. "He
is a very thin monkey,"
said she; "we had better
put him in the larder for
a week to fatten him,
and then ask Mr. Bear
to dinner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="280" height="367" alt="lions putting monkey in stone &quot;cage&quot;" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>So they put him in the
larder, which was just a
little piece at the end of
their cave, built up with
big stones, and while the
lion built it up, the lioness
lay ready to spring on
him if he tried to escape.
It was very dark and very
cold, and Jacko did not
like it at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="281" height="169" alt="lioness writing leaf-letter" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>They left a little window
to feed him by, and
every day they gave him
as many bananas as he
liked, because they knew
monkeys ate bananas,
and they could get them
easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="279" height="177" alt="bear writing leaf-letter" />
</div>



<p>Then the lioness wrote
a leaf-letter to the bear,
asking him to dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
which he, of course,
accepted with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="278" height="184" alt="monkey giving extra bananas to rats" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jacko did not get
fat, and the reason of
that was that he soon
tired of bananas, and
only ate one every day.
He gave all the others to
the rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The lion and lioness
were rather worried because
Jacko did not get
fat, so one day they stole
in to listen to him talking
to the rats, and as it
happened they were just
talking about bananas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am tired of bananas,"
said Jacko. "I wish I
could get a cocoa-nut."</p>

<p>"It would make you
very fat," said the rats.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jacko, "and
I don't want to be fat
for those old lions."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" said the
lions. "A cocoa-nut will
make him fat; we'll get
him one at once."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="292" height="383" alt="lions looking up at cocoa-nut tree" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>But when they came
to the tree they could
not reach a single cocoa-nut!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="278" height="351" alt="lion talking to rat in rocks" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>So the lion went back
and told the little rats
<i>very fiercely</i> that he would
tear down the stones, and
eat them all up at once,
if they did not fetch him
down some cocoa-nuts at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="283" height="371" alt="cocoa-nuts fell on heads of lions" />
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>This terrified the little
rats. They scampered
up the tree, and gnawed
off the cocoa-nuts as fast
as they ever could.</p>

<p>But as the cocoa-nuts
fell on the heads of the
lion and lioness, and hurt
them very much, the
little rats took care to
stay up the tree till it
was dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as their heads
felt a little better, the
lion and lioness took the
cocoa-nuts.</p>

<p>And carried them to
Jacko.</p>

<p>They had to make a
very large hole to put
them in, but they built
it up carefully again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="275" height="282" alt="Jacko craking open a cocoa-nut" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Jacko was very much
delighted to get the
cocoa-nuts, but he had
hard work tearing off the
hairy outside.</p>

<p>However at last he got
it all off. Then he
smashed the cocoa-nuts
with a stone, and drank
the milk, and began eating
the nut; and wasn't
it good after a whole
week of bananas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="276" height="269" alt="Jacko is pudgy" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>While he ate it, he
amused himself making
a nice warm coat for
himself of the hairy husk
of the cocoa-nuts, and he
was so busy he did not
notice how much he was
eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="284" height="217" alt="Jacko in his warm coat" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he put his
warm coat on he just
looked fearfully fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="271" height="203" alt="lions looking in the larder" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>And the lion and
lioness peeping in,
thought it was all Jacko,
and they were delighted.</p>

<p>"Isn't he fat and tender?"
they said. "We'll
eat him to-night, and not
wait for Mr. Bear."</p>

<p>And they went out for
a walk, to get a good
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="287" height="270" alt="Jacko smearing himself with bananas" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Jacko! He did
not eat any more cocoa-nut
after he heard that.
He pulled off his coat,
and smoothed his hair
down with his little paws,
but still he looked fat.</p>

<p>And he smeared himself
all over with bananas
to make the hair lie flat,
but <i>still</i> he looked fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>So he put on his warm
coat again, and lay down,
and cried himself to
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>But you must know
the bear was a very
greedy old bear, and that
very afternoon, while
Jacko was asleep, he
came to have a private
peep at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he saw him
looking so lovely and fat,
he just could not resist
the temptation, and began
pulling down the
stones as fast as he could,
intending to eat him all
by himself. But he was
an awkward, clumsy old
bear, and all of a
sudden&mdash;</p>

<div class='unindent'>the stones all came down
on top of him, waking
poor little Jacko, and
scaring him nearly out
of his wits. But he had
the sense to scramble
out as fast as he could.</div>

<p>The lion and lioness
were just coming back,
and when they heard the
noise they came tearing
home like the wind, and
met little Jacko just in
the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>With a fearful roar the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>With another fearful
roar, the lioness seized
him in her teeth.</p>

<p>But Jacko was so
round with eating cocoa-nut,
and so slippery with
banana, that he popped
out from between her
teeth, like an orange
seed, and ran on.</p>

he was safe, and scrambling
up the cocoa-nut
tree at a rate which
shook down most of the
cocoa-nuts on to the
heads of the lion and

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
